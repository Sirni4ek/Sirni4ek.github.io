    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my website!</p>

    <h2>Black-box testing</h2>
    <p>Testing of something we cannot look inside of, including the source code.</p>

    <h2>White-box testing</h2>
    <p>When we can look inside the product, including the source code and database contents.</p>

    <h2>Regression testing</h2>
    <p>When we look for old problems to see if they have appeared again.</p>

    <h2>Functional testing</h2>
    <p>Testing for the actual functionality the program is written to perform.</p>

    <h2>Exploratory testing</h2>
    <p>Random testing of whatever comes to mind, without a script.</p>

    <h2>Usability testing</h2>
    <p>Testing by a user, observed by developer. (We cannot do it by ourselves.)</p>

    <h2>A/B testing</h2>
    <p>Comparing how users react to different versions of the software, giving some users one version, and other users a different version.</p>

    <h2>Manual testing</h2>
    <p>Testing of the program by hand, just like a user would.</p>

    <h2>Automated testing</h2>
    <p>Writing of a program to test the program, either to test the code itself, or to simulate a user's actions.</p>

    <h2>Integration testing</h2>
    <p>Checking the interactions between different components or systems.</p>

    <h2>Smoke testing</h2>
    <p>Quick cursory check of the system to ensure "no smoke", or nothing obviously wrong.</p>
